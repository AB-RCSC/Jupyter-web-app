"i Camera spacing - Spatially independent for species diversity and richness: locations should be independent, meaning that any two locations do not sample the same community of animals. Note - this may be hard to achieve when considering the movement distances of some species, such as big cats, and in practice, a camera spacing of 1-2 km is often used (e.g., Tobler et al., 2008; Ahumada et al., 2011; Kinnaird & O'Brien, 2012)",I,Camera spacing,Spatially independent for species diversity and richness,"Locations should be independent, meaning that any two locations do not sample the same community of animals.

"iii Camera arrangement - Targeted design for CR: This design is commonly used when estimating densities of marked populations (e.g., spatially explicit capture-recapture [SECR; Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008]) or behaviour studies. However, targeted sampling may impede the ability to draw inferences beyond the survey area (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).",iii,Camera arrangement,Targeted design for CR,"This design is commonly used when estimating densities of marked populations (e.g., spatially explicit capture-recapture [SECR; Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008]) or behaviour studies.
